# HADOOP-SPARK-BASED-REAL-TIME-ONLINE-SALES-DATA-ANALYSI

In the current world, everyone follows the trend of internet shopping. E-commerce websites have made it simpler and are the primary channel for companies to reach customers, regardless of their location, preferences, or interests.
It's critical to examine reliable sales statistics. The ability to make decisions is facilitated, sales quality is upheld, and clients are better understood, all of which lead to future performance gains.

This project aims to compile real-time sales data for products sold across numerous platforms in a number of states. The result produced shows the sales of each source in various states, which helps to improve cross-platform marketing strategies.
